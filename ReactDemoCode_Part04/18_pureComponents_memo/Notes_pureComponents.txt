Pure Component
==============
A PureComponent implements the shouldComponentUpdate lifecycle methods by performing a shallow comparison on the props and state of the component. 
If there is no difference, the component is not re-rendered, which gives performance boost.

React.Memo
===========
To make functional components pure, wrap functional components with higher order component, React.Memo.
